## Overview

Currently, I am learning C++ and how to use Unreal Engine 5. To do this I am watching lectures from the ***Unreal Engine 5 C++ Game Development (Updated 5.6)*** course on *Udemy*. I am currently creating a puzzle game by following the lectures, and I intend to incorporate other features to the game as I continue to learn more about blueprints and C++ in Unreal Engine 5.
